Files and Utilities for VRToolbox



1)For Skymaps, go to the "Skymaps" folder and download the zip file.  Unzip the file and place the dds files into the VRToolbox "Textures" directory.  They will then be available in game, under the drop down list in the "Settings" window.  If you decide to change the file name, VRToolbox requires the "_360" part of it.

This branch has been combined into the main branch at https://github.com/Strydir/SSLoader

Including the Skymaps.  Although the Skymaps are available here as well, any additional ones will only be uploaded to the SSLoader site.
