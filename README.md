Files and Utilities for VRToolbox



1)For Skymaps, go to the "Skymaps" folder and download the zip file.  Unzip the file and place the dds files into the VRToolbox "Textures" directory.  They will then be available in game, under the drop down list in the "Settings" window.  If you decide to change the file name, VRToolbox requires the "_360" part of it.

2)Welcome to my Steam Shortcut Loader for VRToolbox.

This is a simplified version of CogentRifter's Home Loader, found here:  https://github.com/CogentHub/HomeLoader.   With his permission, I have modified it for my needs.
Go to the "releases" tab and download the latest version.

I zipped the entire folder so unzip it to your drive or folder of choice and simply run "SSLoader_for_VRToolbox.exe".  I would suggest making a shortcut to the exe and placing it on your desktop.

Use this program to go thru your Steam Library and create web pages of your Steam Games for use in VRToolbox. Note that these shortcuts won't work without VRToolbox.  If you want a version that will work from your desktop, see my other version here: https://github.com/Strydir/SSLoader.  I'll be combining them soon, but for now they are separate.

In addition to customized lists of your games that you can access in VRToolbox, you can also create shortcuts that can be linked to objects to create "Object Shortcuts" that can be placed anywhere, similar to Valve's "Trophies".  The best objects for this use that I've found so far are the picture frame or the little "Jetson's" TV.

You can also use this utility to change your SteamVR Home.  Currently, you can choose between SteamVR Home, VRToolbox, Virtual Desktop and BigScreen beta.  Just make sure that you change it back to SteamVR Home before you move or delete this program.
