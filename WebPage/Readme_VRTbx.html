<h1>Welcome to my Steam Shortcut Loader for VRToolbox</h1>

<div class="readme">

<div class="Top">
Installation:  Unzip to your drive or folder of choice and simply run the exe file.  I recommend making a shortcut to the exe and placing it on your desktop.
</div>
<br>
<ul class="Main">

	<li>At First Start, the program will be using the default Steam installation path.  If you've changed it or added more directories, click on the "Set Steam Folders" button in the lower right.   
	When you have your Steam Folders set, click the "Scan Steam Libraries" button in the upper right to add your games to the Library.</li><br>
	
	<li>When the scan is complete, you'll have a list of your games.  The information in the columns is still a wip, but the game and app id's will be accurate.</li><br>
	
	<li> To add games to your custom Tabs, click the boxes to select your games, then move down to the bottom left and click the "Choose Tab" button to select between the 4 custom tabs.  Click the "Add to Custom" button to add the selected games to that tab.
	Right click to move your game up or down, delete it, or look at the Steam Database for the game (another work in progress).  </li><br>

	<li>Once you have your tab set up the way that you like it, go to that tab, click the "All" box to select your games (deselect it and choose your individual games if you'd like)
	and press the "Create Game Page" button.  This will create your GamePage in the "Webpage" directory.</li><br>

	<li>To access your new Game Pages, click the "Make StartPage" button.  This will create a file called "StartPage.html".  This is the name of the file that VRToolbox uses when you  "Add Screens".  
	The file that you just created will have all of the links from the original, plus the Search box, but now it will also have icons for each Tab, an icon for TVCuts and 4 more icons for a couple of clock and date variations.</li><br>

	<li>Replace the StartPage in VRToolbox. For now, I've left this as a manual step:  you must now go to the install folder for VRToolbox and rename the file "StartPage.html" to "StartPageOld.html".  
	Once you've done that you can click the "Open Folder" button in the Loader to open the folder holding your new customized version.  Copy and paste that into the VRToolbox folder.  
	Now, when you "Add Screens" in VRToolbox, you should see your new customized page with access to your new Games Pages.</li><br>

	<li>The "TVCuts" Page is for making Object Shortcuts to your games.  It is a page of all of your Steam Apps.  Each icon leads to another page that is exclusively that App.  This page can then be resized, linked and locked to an object to give you individual 
	Object Shortcuts to your games that you can place on shelves, counters or wherever you want!</li><br>

	<li>To make best use your new pages, make sure that you use the in game menus to customize the page size and set the background transparency to "Alpha".</li>

</ul>

<div class="Top"><p>That's all there is to it!  I hope it helps!</p></div>
