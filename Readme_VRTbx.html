<h1>Welcome to the Steam Shortcut Loader for VRToolbox</h1>

<div class="readme">

<div class="Top">
Installation:  Unzip to your drive or folder of choice and simply run the exe file.  I recommend making a shortcut to the exe and placing it on your desktop.  
All environment variables are set when you run the program the first time so to move it, delete the folder and files and unzip a new version to your new location.  Then make new
files at the new location.  Note that you will need to re-create your VRToolbox StartPage as well.
</div>
<br>
<div class="Top">
Removal:  Make sure that you've set your SteamVR Home back to SteamVR and then delete the folder. Go to your VRToolbox utils directory and delete the StartPage file.  Then rename 
StartPage.bak to StartPage.html.  An upcoming version will provide a button to do this for you.
<div>

<br>
<div class="Main">

	<p>At First Start, the program will be using the default Steam installation path.  If you've changed it or added more directories, click on the "Set Steam Library Folders" button in the upper right.   
	When you have your Steam Folders set, click the "Scan Steam Library Folders" button below it to add your games to the Library.</p>
	
	When the scan is complete, you will have a list of all of your Steam Games. 
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<p> To add games to your custom Tabs:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check the boxes on the left to select your games, or click "All" on the right side of the page, then look to the right on the page and</li>
			<li>Click the "Choose Tab" button to select between the 4 custom tabs.</li>  
			<li>Click the "Add to Custom" button to add the selected games to that tab.</li>
		
	Now select the tab to see your list.  Right click on a game to move it up or down, delete it, or look at the Steam Database for game information.  
	Once you have your tab set up the way that you like it, click the "All" box to select your games (deselect it and choose your individual games if you'd like)
	and then
			<li>Press the "Create Game Page" button.  This will create your Custom GamePage.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>To see your new Game Pages in VRToolbox, click the "Change VRToolbox StartPage" button.  This will replace a file called "StartPage.html" in your VRToolbox utils directory, which
	is the file that VRToolbox uses when you "Add Screens".  The file that you just created will be the same as the original, but it will now also have icons for each Tab, an icon for TVCuts
	and 4 more icons for a couple of clock and date variations.</li><br>

	<li>To set your SteamVR Home, click the bullet next to the program that you want to use. Whenever SteamVR starts or when you exit your VR experience, it will launch the experience that you chose,
	rather than the normal SteamVR Home. Note that your game pages are only useful with VRToolbox. </li><br>
	
	<li>The "TVCuts" Page is for making Object Shortcuts to your games.  It is a page of all of your Steam Apps.  Each icon leads to another page that is exclusively that App.  
	This page can then be resized, linked and locked to an object to give you individual Object Shortcuts to your games that you can place on shelves, counters or wherever you want!</li><br>

	<li>Use the "Add Game" button to add non-steam games and experiences.  Then click "Select File" and navigate to the exe.  Once you've selected that, choose your icon by clicking "Select Icon"
	or you can use the default "Icon Preview".  When you are satisfied, click "Save": this will save the shortcut under the Non-Steam App Tab.  Repeat until you have all of your choices made and press the "Close" button to leave.</li><br>
	<li>To make best use your new pages, make sure that you use the in-game menus to customize the page size and set the background transparency to "Alpha".</li>
